When you solve a day's puzzle with your official Advent of Code input:
  - push your solution to your public git repo
  - run your solution on your official puzzle input
  - post your statistics to the Statistics thread:
    #t.img(src: "/example-stats.png", style: "width: 600px; max-width: 100%")

Your solution should be one program that outputs the answer to Part 1 and Part 2.
The statistics will measure the time to compute both results.

We'll update the leaderboard with the latest stats when we can throughout the day.
Feel free to post new statistics if you improve your solution.
